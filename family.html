		<h2>Family Members</h2>
		<p>The first role models children have come from close family members. This is why the family has an important role in the children’s future. Family relationships not only shape their view of the world and their surroundings but also give kids the necessary tools to successfully sail through life.</p>
		<p>Often, the little ones begin the learning process by copying gestures from mom and dad, brothers and sisters, or by playing during the summer break, or during holidays with their cousins and extended family. These family activities help children develop bonds with their close ones which are key to having a healthy social life later on.</p>
		<p>Children feel like they belong to something greater when they can identify with their family members. So, by learning about people related to them they can feel part of something while growing up. It’s great for the little ones to know their families roots through their grandparents’ stories, or how big is their family tree as they figure out how many aunts, uncles, and cousins they have.</p>
		<p>As they grow up, learning the family member’s names and relationships don’t only help the little ones with their own family relationships, but also to create healthier connections with teachers, friends, and other people in their lives.</p>
